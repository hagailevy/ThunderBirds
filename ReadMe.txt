Points that may be eligible for the bonus:

1. Gravity:
Gravity is realistically implemented so that the following functionalities work:
a. When blocks are in a state of drag then on a certain floor, then when the first block reaches a state where "there is no ground" it begins to fall realistically.
b. When a block is on a boat, and the boat is moving downward then the code simulates a realistic form of free fall for the block.
c. In situations where there are movements of the X and Y axes then the working order exists as in a world where there are the laws of gravity.

Carrying:
2. a. The boats can carry blocks and function in a completely realistic way in all directions (up, down, left and right).
b. In the event of a block falling on the boat, the possibility that the block killed the boat is examined.
c. A boat can carry more than one block provided it has enough "power" to do so.
d. Friction capabilities are performed as in real life for example:
When a ship is towing a block and there is a wall which the boat can pass but its carrier cannot pass, then the boat will pass and the carrier will be subject to the law of gravity.
Of course the order of operations happens as it does in our world.


The system can contain any block which is symmetrical and asymmetrical blocks, and any shape you choose like a rectangle, triangle, an 'A' shaped block or anything in your head.

Thank you very much for reading the file on our work review.
